[resolvego project](https://github.com/Rivado-E/resolvego)
I am checking the current capacity of the project
- [x] udp server
- [x] deciphering the incoming dns message
- [x] pass the forwarding server  
- [x] dial and get the ips back, do we only support ipv4?
- [ ] serve the answer back, as dns message
    - what changes in the message?
    - what might be expected but is not here?
